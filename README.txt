simple python aim trainer

tracks your time "alive", speed (targets per second), the amount of targets you clicked, and your clicking accuracy.



FUTURE PLANS:

create a main menu where you can choose how fast targets appear (difficulty levels)

"Arcade mode"
after hitting an x amount of targets, speed is increased.
